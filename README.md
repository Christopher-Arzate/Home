## About Me:

Hi there, My Name is Christopher or call me Chris for short.

I'm a curious data wrangler who loves to find meaning in different datasets. This interest came from my degree and time learning Data Science I want my skills to create an impact on people in need. When I'm not interested in data, I'm an amateur cellular photographer who loves taking urban/rural scenery, playing video games such as Elden Ring and Pokemon, and listening to J-rock, Metal, and Pop music. Currently, I am looking for a job where I can utilize my analytics/scientific skills and continue learning how these skills are used in the workplace.   

## Projects

In this project, I went to Kaggle to find a dataset where I could review my data analysis and machine learning libraries I learned from my college classes. I found a data set called **[Latest Laptop Price List](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kuchhbhi/latest-laptop-price-list)** which had different brands of laptops, their hardware specs, and the price. This dataset piqued my interest since my interest in technology. In this project, I  analyze the price of a laptop based on its hardware and used classification models to classify brands of laptops based on their specs.

Our task was to group up with other analysts to look into a carbon emissions dataset uncover some observations and create insights based on these observations. My role in the project was to look into each continent and Identify who were the most emitting countries in history.

In this project, this was my capstone project for my fellowship at COOP. Our task was to group up with other analysts to look into a simulated media company's historical data to see if certain areas of the dataset could lead to plans for the company. My role in the project was being the Audience analyst so I was responsible for looking into the different audience segments and using KPI to identify the best/worst audiences and create 3 personality personas to present in a PowerPoint.
